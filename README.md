# js.bundle.require

Automatic JS Bundling with RequireJS and Mustache Support.

Traverses a configurable root directory for \*.js and \*.mustache files and includes all
assets in one optimized bundle.

The build process uses the following libraries:
- requirejs optimizer
- almond
- mustache
- requirejs mustache loader


### Example
```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/js.bundle.require
------------- includes ----------------
tpl/foo.js
tpl/foo.mustache
tpl/partials/bar.mustache
-------------- output -----------------
tpl/dist/bundle.js
tpl/dist/bundle.dev.js
```
